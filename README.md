Genesys provides a simple way to make rich, accessible, interactive prototypes using a declarative language (HTML). It enables designers and UI developers to quickly create a low to high-fidelity prototypes, or even production-ready user interfaces. 

Genesys provides support for most major design systems like Bootstrap, Material Design, Foundation, Ionic, Tailwind, Tachyons, et. al.) and you can add any others. 

Additional features include multi-lingual support, automated walk-throughs, on-screen comments, A/B testing, conditional logic, animation, and more, all through markup.

*Note that Genesys allows you to create and test fully accessible, Section 508-compliant prototypes.*
