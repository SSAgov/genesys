Design Tips when using VS Code
==============================

Visual Studio Code provides built-in assistance for creating HTML prototypes. This section presents tips for using this assistance.

Before using the tips presented below, make sure you've installed the `Design in the Browser Extension Pack` for Visual Studio Code. (You can search for it from the Extensions tab.)

Using the Problems tab to find and fix issues
---------------------------------------------

It can be very useful to select the `View` > `Problems` menu item. This will display the Problems panel, which tell's you exactly where you have issues in your HTML. Keep this panel open as you create your prototype page, and you'll be likely to spot issues as they occur.

In most cases, many of these issues can safely be ignored when creating a prototype. However, it does become useful for pointing out spelling errors, missing tags, accessibility problems, or other issues that may be causing problems with interactivity.
