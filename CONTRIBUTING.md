## Contributing Code

Code-level contributions generally come in the form of [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests). These are done by forking the repo and making changes locally.

The process of proposing a change to Genesys can be summarized as follows:

1. Fork the Genesys repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. Make the desired changes to the source code.
3. Test your updates locally.
4. If you've changed or added something, update the documentation in the `README.md` file.
5. Push the changes to your fork.
6. Create a pull request to the Genesys repository.
7. We will review and address comments on your pull request.

If all goes well, your pull request will be merged. If it is not merged, maintainers will do their best to explain the reason why.
